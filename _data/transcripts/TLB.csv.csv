[00:00:02],Sylvia,"Super. So the goal of my research really is to understand the character of kind of um Lebanese community organizing that's happening through the Instagram space. So I'm a master student in geography, and i'm studying space in the sense that, we're creating spaces in this digital world that also inform our lives outside of the digital world.",
[00:00:31],SF,"And I see this happening a lot with Lebanese community that it takes a very interesting form, because it's so transnational. But there are also really important specific places that it impacts. For example, thinking about Beirut and the port explosion, or thinking about the Revolution, and how that shows up in different places around the world. There's this culminating space that I saw on Instagram. So i'm trying to get a sense of what's going on, what's going on in this space, And particularly i'm looking between 2019 and 2020 through these big events.",
[00:01:10],SF,"Part of my methods are looking at posts and comments and captions. But i'm also really interested in people, the you know, real people behind the accounts. And so that's why I reached out for an interview. So that's my project. Do you have any questions for me?",
[00:01:30],CS,"I just want to clarify, because it's cutting off, are you gathering information from the NGO TLB point of view or from the individual point of view, as in the person behind uh the people behind the organization or us in personal life?",
[00:02:01],SF,"Hmm. Well, I mean a little everything. However, I am reaching out to you through  the organization and I'll be talking to you about the account.",
[00:02:28],CS,"So uh, as in, like, I said behind the account, Right?",
[00:02:30],SF,Yeah.,
[00:02:35],CS,"okay, Great. So like TLB as the ngo.",
[00:02:45],SF,"Yeah. And actually, maybe before we dive into my questions, I could ask you, how did the Ngo get started?",
[00:02:48],CS,"Of course. All right. So the Ngo started back in beginning 2020, just when the economic collapse was starting to. Uh, arise if you want, was starting to, was beginning, and the Board members, who are six people uh who kind of have the extensive experience in the Ngo development, and uh, as powerful network and um connections with experts and private donors decided to come together to found uh the this organization as a collaborative platform in order to help the local Ngos respond to the crisis. So that's how the story started. They came together, six members, and they decided to connect the Lebanese diaspora e to the local Ngos here, working on the ground.",bridging; collaboration; place; 
[00:03:48],CS,"What happened is when, right after the explosion happened, they had to accelerate and start the intervention. So they were registered, as i'm saying, they because I joined them a bit later myself.",
[00:04:03],CS,"So we um they we started working, if you want September 2020, right after the explosion, when uh, as an intervention to the Beirut blast, after the Beirut blast. We registered in the US. And we’re still not registered in Lebanon. However, our audience and our uh goal is to really bring uh all experts Um, local Ngos, International Ngos, and different members who like to collaborate and work to create sustainable solutions and implement them in Lebanon. Now, how are we different than others is because we look to be involved from A to Z in the entire process. So we're involved in identification of the of the problem, gathering data, connecting with experts, designing solutions, implementing, monitoring and then evaluating",place; collaboration; bridging; truth
[00:05:02],CS,"and and and reporting. So we're involved in the entire process. We so far have worked closely with partner Ngos, that are that have a track record, and and the experience of the fields in the sectors we work in,",
[00:05:19],CS,"and we are now starting to collaborate more and more with social entrepreneurs as well. So if you want our Instagram, let's say, because we're talking about social media. Our social media started at first as a way to uh, you know, have a presence, have visibility, and uh, keep a bit like the community informed. And then we said,",
[00:05:43],CS,"Maybe we're keeping our donors informed, maybe instantly, instead of waiting every time for a report or for a status update. And you know news that's there and all the traditional communication uh methods, means. But now it has changed uh tremendously, and that quickly became very, very important uh Not only to keep uh our donors informed, but have this with window and and um position, and and confirm our place, if you want.",proximity; place; bridging
[00:06:25],CS,"Fundraising activities are becoming more and more online. So You probably saw us a bit during the 19.8 Beirut challenge, the sports challenge.  This was the second edition. So the first edition was last year when we called on everyone to um to practice the support of their choice for Lebanon to collect funds and raise awareness on the needs in Lebanon. Actually, it was Beirut back then.",proximity; bridging; hope
[00:06:53],CS,"And this year we continued with edition 2, because this really engages the entire community and reinforces the the collaboration of everyone donors, experts uh Lebanese non lebanese uh diaspora working for Lebanon. [honk]",collaboration; bridging
[00:07:12],CS,So our activity online is increasing. And now today we look at Instagram as a priority. It's one of the main ways to-,bridging
[00:07:25],CS,"We're not very happy about it, but it has, we have no choice, because it is the main gateway and window to keep our owners informed on the spot to show them the humans behind the work uh be on site uh give them a window to the daily uh operations going on, off report on the report, you know, off and on records, and it just keeps us closer to our donors and people who are interested in the welfare of Lebanon.",barriers; proximity
[00:08:00],CS,"So um, I don't know if you want to move on to the next question, or if I could give you also like, uh, because when you were talking uh like giving me an overview on the project, I looked back, and I saw how, since 2019, since the you know how the how social media played uh with the revolution breaking out, and how it has become very quickly important for Lebanese to be connected, uh and well informed, because there were so many. Uh first of all, there were so many uh sources of information and platforms coming up and surging, so nobody knew which was the right information which was unbiased, which was not affiliated politically, which was not a propaganda which was organic, and uh, afterwards axes, and became very uh",truth; barriers
[00:09:00],CS,"significant here in to like you in in Lebanon. A lot of the main names in the revolution as activists became known to be a source of information or source of motivation or kind of leading this this movement, and then afterwards uh misinformation became very- I mean backlash quickly",truth; barriers
[00:09:22],CS,"So people started identifying the [undecipherable] and it keeps happening until today. And afterwards I think it also became a very important tool after the explosion, to keep everyone connected to see where the needs are, how people were acting informally, coming together uh, not always unconventional basis, you know. So it was very crisis response. Not not everything was planned, not everything was calculated, not everything was organized and checked. It was very spontaneous, and people were like",bridging; proximity; truth
[00:10:06],CS,"coming together online, communicating, checking what's being done uh working and showing what they've done, and people were sending money from outside and sending funds based on what they were seeing online because it was the most instant. And it was live from the ground.",bridging; proximity; truth
[00:10:27],CS,"And I think today the Ngos that have survived, and that have uh, you know, accomplished, their projects are looking at this.",
[00:10:43],CS,"So, very important. Now you see every regular release. Every average Lebanese follows some key accounts uh, whether it be activists or newspapers or news hubs online.",proximity; bridging; place
[00:11:11],SF,"Yeah, that's that's very interesting. I I think goes quite well with my own observations. What do you think that engagement on Instagram then offers from different kinds of connection? I mean you talked about the fact that it's very instant, but you also see that there's space for misinformation.",
[00:11:33],CS,Um! A lot more space for misinformation. Could you just talk a little bit more about that one?,
[00:11:44],SF,"The misinformation? Sorry. Yeah, or you know, have you found limitations to the platform? Because you also mentioned earlier, you know, we're all on Instagram. You know whether that's a good or a bad thing. But have you found that the platform causes…like that there are limitations to connecting through this means?",
[00:12:06],CS,Hmm limitations…,
[00:12:11],CS,"not limitation. I wouldn't call them limitations, I would say, uh lack of control and regulations, because, the information was accessible to everyone. And um!",
[00:12:32],CS,"It was difficult at some time to recognize the, you know. How are we...not manipulated, but like, where is propaganda? Who is behind all this fuel? Who's fueling all this? Um, you know some of it is organic from the movement from the people, and other things are. Uh, you know you. There's a lack of There's a no lack of trust.",truth; barriers
[00:12:56],CS,"But there's uh, you know. You wonder at some point. How did it all start? How is it traveling? How's the information traveling? Because of the, you know, the algorithm. The um, sources of information. Uh, you know in Lebanon. It's uh it's inevitable. There's the the West and the East, and how the information is distributed on uhonline. It's hard, it's hard to identify. When, where… Is it from the people? And why is it, I mean, who are the media outlets? Who's behind them?",truth; barriers
[00:13:36],CS,"And what interest do they have in this information? And people choose uh keep on this information, if you want.",truth; barriers
[00:13:48],SF,"Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense. So let's see. How have you encountered any surprises? Well, are you the person that runs the uh Ngo's Instagram account?",
[00:14:03],CS,"Yes, so. But I just noticed that I answered the question before, as the you know individually, rather than from the eyes of the Ngo. Because, yeah, it's…we have different sources of information. It's not really uh from online, You know, we look at the research articles uh with universities, with the um organizations.",truth
[00:14:35],SF,And that's how you inform the things that you share?,
[00:14:38],CS,"I mean as a Ngo, Yeah. And we based our information on the ground uh on the research and studies uh published by uh, local or international universities, by uh international organizations by the and some of them by the ministry. So our Ngos have um their sources of information, and they include them. The proposal that they submit to us, and we also provide them with information when it's on that.",truth
[00:15:18],SF,"yeah, i'm curious. Because um uh one of the things with using Instagram, is It's quite immediate which you mentioned. Um, so you can send out, you know, correct or incorrect information very quickly. But, um! Whenever let's see, relying on sources on the ground that have some type, some kind of publication that takes a lot more time. But i'm curious about the time piece, and how the Ngo has responded to acquiring, very quickly, information and figuring out what is and what isn't true in order to respond, because initially, it was very closely linked to um responding to needs after the blast. Right?",
[00:16:11],SF,"So how to deal with this issue of time? Um. Which I think is something that Instagram offered very quickly. Or how did you process inquiries? If? Um, maybe the mechanisms for fact checking are very time intensive.",
[00:16:38],CS,"Yeah, no, uh. We get back to uh a request or inquiry with, you know, like well received, acknowledged. If we have the information on hand, we uh we confirm, but we're not like. We're not the information uh outlet or source. So we say, this is the information we have from this source.",
[00:17:07],CS,"Um! And that's how we call that. That's how we contribute or collaborate or head. However, if we don't, if you want to do a fact, check, we say like. We need that many days to check with our partner Ngos, who are more updated, for example, on on this issue, and we'll get back to you, however, the most most of the time they request we have gotten uh, we're related to the beneficiaries, so we put them in direct touch with the",
[00:17:34],CS,"NGO in question, and for information, we encourage debates on our page to engage the community. So we, for example, we never. You know our role is to suggest sustainable solutions. So we say our suggestion. Our strategy is this, and we always welcome people to you know, agree or disagree. Encourage Donate to believe in uh, how they can help. Uh, we have questions on. For example, Are you guys involved in this? Are you working on that? We think this is a priority, and we say like, if it's within our scope or not. Yet.",
[00:18:18],CS,"So that's how we hand that information it's more uh because we haven't really faced the…we're not very. We're very, you know non-political uh non-religious, you know, um just working in our scope, and we really respect that. So we say, this is our role. This is what we are trying to do. We don't claim that we have, uh all the information, especially in a country like Lebanon, where data is really scarce and really inaccurate and unavailable.",
[00:18:49],CS,"So we we are on the ground. We see what's going on, and if there are no studies, we base ourselves on what we we mentioned, what we have relied on. But we were never, uh really faced with the situation where we had to provide such sensitive information. And uh, because we are not the source.",
[00:19:20],SF,"Yeah, Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. So which Ngos do you- Or how many Ngos do you partner with? And is that something listed on a website somewhere? Where can I find that",
[00:19:49],CS,for mental health,
[00:19:51],CS,"uh house of the House of Christmas? Uh, for the sectors of heritage and uh livelihood, the support of micro businesses, and Lebanon needs back, then, for the Uh health care sector.",collaboration
[00:20:05],CS,"This intervention, the second one, because we have completed twelve projects with the these Ngos, and we have concluded our phase one intervention. So the phase, the phase two, the one that started this July 2022. We are working- We are still working with the for mental health,",collaboration
[00:20:25],CS,"and we are working as well with the House of Christmas for heritage and livelihood, because it makes sense. We are moving on to the next stage. I'll tell you why, shortly.",collaboration
[00:20:36],CS,"But for the health care we are working with social entrepreneurs who have track records, and that are pretty active in their feeds.",collaboration
[00:20:48],CS,"So we are collaborating with them if you want, and working with them when you have called them the kind of the entrepreneurs task force, the social entrepreneurs task force, and we are working with them for the health care and the health care sector.",collaboration
[00:21:04],CS,"So we're kind of independence. But, uh, people will have a track record.",
[00:21:12],SF,Got it.,
[00:21:15],CS,"So, For why are we still working working with the same partners? Because, for example, the House of Christmas with livelihoods for the livelihood sector: The first intervention was about uh, mainly supporting micro businesses after the blast to uh get the you know, rehabilitate.",collaboration
[00:22:53],CS,"It was about helping- The first intervention was about helping the micro businesses and the small entrepreneurs of Lebanon get back on their feet, especially in the affected area after the blast.",collaboration
[00:23:07],CS,"So we're talking about the you know, the small hairdresser, the grocery store, the daily life, the soul of of the neighborhoods. We wanted to help them get back on their feet and sustain and navigate the crisis.",collaboration
[00:23:21],CS,"Uh so it was more uh rehabilitation support uh physical rehabilitation uh comprehensive and strategic support. Uh, you know, getting them supplies uh capacity, building and everything. And out of the these one hundred and twenty businesses that we supported ninety-eight today are still operational. So that means it was really beneficial, because, unfortunately, a lot of funds were disbursed. Places and cases were rehabilitated, but not everything survived the crisis.",collaboration; hope; despair
[00:23:53],CS,So this was very important for us as a confirmation of the the approach we are using.,
[00:23:58],CS,"And so, what with the house of Christmas, our partner and livelihood, we during our work, we we noticed that a lot of Lebanese small factories were extremely underutilized as low as twenty percent uh utilization rates,",
[00:24:13],CS,"and they were not, uh, you know, operating at full capacity. And it. This comes at a time where local production is very important to encourage, because we can no longer rely on exports as an economy. And this is where we decided to move on to the next phase, and it took me total sense to support these small producers and factories and turn them into a manufacturing hubs, like a shared manufacturing facilities.",
[00:24:43],CS,"And this is what we what we're doing. So it was kind of a continuation, and moving up from the profile. So we moved on to slightly bigger businesses that can create more jobs, retain more jobs uh have more growth, opportunities and export and franchise uh possibilities.",
[00:25:09],SF,Great! And that's the That's this coming the next intervention.,
[00:25:13],CS,"Yes, this is the next introduction. We're still supporting eight businesses. So small a larger in size bit more medium if you want to create more jobs, and uh, you know, to allow them to have a franchise or to export, and at the same time, but the our focus will be on turning uh uh four of these businesses into manufacturing hubs",futurity; collaboration
[00:25:35],CS,"for these factories, because they are factories, and they're across the But not so. It's no longer in the route. We also moved uh out and this is where we're working to, you know, to create these hubs across Lebanon.",
[00:25:56],SF,"Mhm great. Yeah, it's exciting! So is all of this- the information about these initiatives- is the best place to find the information on the Instagram Page?",
[00:26:11],CS,"Good question. Not the best way. It's a good way ha, you know, if you want headlines, it's on the Instagram page. If you want to share transparency, because you know, one of our main values is transparency. So if you want to know what is our strategy? Vaguely, who are a few of our beneficiaries? What have we worked on? Yes, it's Instagram, but all of our donors request that we share with them like a fundraising deck.",place
[00:26:46],CS,"It's a deck that you know, uh summarizes and talks about covers all the points of the intervention from a general to case by case. We call them kind of a zoom in. So we have the main deck that that that talks about the Ngo, the approach, the way we work, how they can help, what is the current situation that we're dealing with?",
[00:27:04],CS,"And then there's the zoom into each sector where we talk in detail about the sector where the needs are, what we suggest as a solution, and how we are going to implement it and then zoom in.",
[00:27:23],CS,"We updated as we go during the project. So it becomes like, uh, you know, the status update, and then at the end it's the you know, the full report, the data and the impact that was done.",
[00:27:38],SF,"Yeah, I feel like, though, you do a good job of taking bite-sized pieces of that and sharing it with people through social media. Um, because, as i'm looking at even captions, there's a lot of information and um, so you use it in a very interesting way,",
[00:27:58],CS,Do we? We're interested in me.,
[00:28:05],CS,"Seventy five percent of our time trying to simplify, and be able to communicate what we do in social media language, which is a very big challenge today, because what we work, what we do is ready for a complex.",bridging; truth
[00:28:22],CS,"We work with Ngos. So we are a charity for charities, and then- but we are involved in the entire process.",
[00:28:30],CS,"So we have a lot of information to share, and it's always like an internal struggle of how we, you know, overwhelming people with information. Is it clear? Can people see it as clearly as we can? You know we have four sectors. We're working with three ngos, four sectors, two. One Ngo is working on two sectors. Sometimes we talk heritage. Sometimes we talk health care, mental health, and people are always like, Wow! So we are doing a bit of everything. And you know, when we do fundraising initiatives, and we try to respond for certain projects, it's never one thing.",
[00:29:06],CS,"So then we end up talking about everything, and honestly, we feel like is this effective? And we're working on that we're working on, you know. Um, we're improving so much because we're only like the the platform is three years old today. We are still working on improving the way we communicate things, the way we simplify things for the public to make it accessible to everyone.",
[00:29:30],CS,"We, you know, show people that each initiative actually makes a great impact. The  unique thing here is that Lebanese people were really overwhelmed with where they wanted to head, because there was so much needed everywhere. So our uh, we felt like our forte was that one dollar can make an impact in four key vital sectors",despair; barriers; hope; collaboration
[00:29:58],CS,"and one dollar can go a really long way, because we're very cost-efficient. And the fact that this collaborative platform exists. It reduces a lot of costs on our local Ngos, because, you know, we avoid the duplicate work. And we start to centralize things where they can be centralized, and that's how we work towards efficiency, transparency, and uh, a bigger impact.",barriers; hope; collaboration; futurity
[00:30:27],CS,"And and so it's not easy to You know type people, you know you're raising funds for these four things. When we do a fundraising activity, people say, “Wow, So these two hundred thousand dollars are going to do all this?” We say, No, they're going to help accomplish all this, because you know it's not one thing.",
[00:30:47],SF,"right, nothing is only doing one thing. Everything is supporting this kind of network of change.",
[00:30:58],SF,So i'm just looking at the time. Do you still have a few more minutes?,
[00:31:00],CS,"So i'm still on the way. I'll tell you when I arrive, and when I have to go.",
[00:31:08],SF,"Okay, perfect. So then I was curious, have you encountered any surprises while running this Instagram page?",
[00:31:19],CS,"Surprises…so I joined in February 2022, and when we organized uh the first addition back in June, 2021, when I didn't exist. If you want June 2021 uh Lebanon was just out of the lockdown uh a very long lockdown and fresh out of the– It was less than a year after the blast.",
[00:31:47],CS,"So when they launched the sports challenge it was, you know they didn't need to uh say a lot what they're trying to do. It was enough to say “people, let's run for Beirut.”; Let's all do our favorite sport forbade with the started response. There was not much awareness needed to be done. It's what the action spoke for itself, and everybody, you know engaged.",collaboration; place
[00:32:09],CS,"We have around four hundred people. Take the challenge uh participate and support the challenge, et cetera.",
[00:32:19],CS,"Now, when we came when I came, when I joined in February, 2022 we wanted to organize the second addition, and the challenge here was extremely uh different, because one we were facing a lot of donor fatigue, because for the past two years the news has been, you know, overwhelming the deputies, for they're over solicited. They've been helping for two years sending money and seeing like no progress. The elections were results were not great. Uh it's just. There was no hope in sight,",barriers; despair
[00:32:50],CS,"and uh, and a lot of activities were being done other than the donor fatigue being there. Why would we stand out with our challenge? And, how would we make people still believe in our mission, and and believe that we're trying to do something.",barriers; despair
[00:33:08],CS,"So the some surprise when I saw the entire community mobilize itself. All the athletes, everyone was so open, was accepting. The challenge was putting. We have to have people putting so much effort, and this was really touching. And you know, gave us a whole like a whole new outlook uh on things.",hope; collaboration; proximity; futurity
[00:33:37],CS,"at the same time we really saw a lot of engagement and people being so involved. So we were pleasantly surprised, and uh, but at the same time it was a big wake up call that fundraising activities today do not, cannot survive. We cannot.",hope; collaboration; proximity; futurity
[00:33:57],CS,"Lebanon cannot survive on,can no longer survive on aid. So we need to. We are actually now looking in the direction of the micro businesses that we're supporting, how we can microfinance them, become partners with them, and uh, you know, so we can keep uh funding the sustainable solutions and keep implementing them.",barriers; futurity; bridging
[00:34:17],CS,"so not never ending cycle. We're not in the kind of the Ngo work on the ground where it's only crisis response on, You know, Meds and foods and needs. It's more that we we have a role in the investments in the country, and kind of like infrastructure we're looking at. You know the mental health of the entire population. We're looking at the health care facilities. They're collapsing. So we're trying to, you know, Diminish This Had them through this crisis.",despair; hope; futurity
[00:34:47],CS,"Light in it on the we're trying to, for the Mac business. We're trying to encourage local production and give it what it they need if them what they need to sustain, and for the Heritage buildings. The All the work is on the Ngo, so we're trying to also play our part, because uh today, if it wasn't, if it weren't for Ngos, the eighty buildings that are an extreme danger. Nobody is looking at them, only Ngos and private donors.",despair; hope; futurity; collaboration
[00:35:20],CS,"Yeah, not the government. Nobody is taking any measures. No one's doing anything. No one's acting on time. And this is not something we can postpone.",despair; futurity
[00:35:36],SF,"Well, that's exciting. The pleasant surprise. I think that those are the key moments that keep us going. Is having these pleasant surprises.",
[00:35:52],CS,"Yes, I mean this moment kept us going. And uh, and this is where I want to tell you Also, on the first question you asked, This is when you really became even more instant because during the challenge we became much closer to our community, and it was really like hot in the action. It was on the spot. Everyone was acting for Lebanon. We had to cover it all. We had to thank them all uh and phones them on. And this is where our page didn't sleep. Basically, we had no time to see.",hope; futurity
[00:36:24],SF,"Yeah, I remember there being a lot of content constantly. Have you formed any new connections through running this account? Have you made connections with people that you would not have maybe otherwise?",
[00:36:42],CS,"Yes, I mean as a platform. It's interesting that because of the challenge, because we were really establishing ourselves, so with the challenge, we have a lot of, you know, sporty people, athletes, et cetera. We are using this platform also to connect to other experts that maybe during our day to day we don't have connections to",bridging
[00:37:10],CS,"and some people that are interested in our work, but are not donors yet, or are not. Uh, you know, volunteers or… so we do. We do have. I mean,",bridging
[00:37:21],CS,"the important thing is to keep the page alive, even though it was not our for work.",bridging; place
[00:37:28],CS,"It's important to keep it alive uh, for the community, and then to, you know, to have a say and what we're doing, and why we're here and to have our place.",bridging
[00:37:49],CS,"today, if you were talking about, no matter how how much of great work they do if they're not on Instagram.",
[00:38:05],SF,Yeah. So How do you feel about the state of this community today? What is the do you? Is there kind of a general feeling that you would describe?,
[00:38:18],CS,"Uh, yes, there is, because today, uh after the blast there were so many Ngos popping up, and so much work was being done. However, there was no regulations. There were no regulations, no uh control, and a lot of the initiatives were kind of individual uh on the spot. For a few moments many of them, I would say eighty or ninety percent were healthy. Of course there were like two or three bugs somewhere uh people made some mistakes. Some people took advantage of the situation, and no matter how uh disproportionate they were to the general.",place
[00:39:07],CS,"So January has the activity, if you want. They kind of ruin it for everybody.",despair
[00:39:13],CS,"And this is where we find ourselves also, you know, facing a critical I. We haven't gotten any surprises on that front, but we're always ready to um defend our credibility and our transparency uh to define it, not to fight it, to just send it. So we felt that we always need to prove. There's a critical I It's a bit sensitive, seeing right now on the current work of Ngos in Lebanon.",truth
[00:39:51],SF,Ah.,
