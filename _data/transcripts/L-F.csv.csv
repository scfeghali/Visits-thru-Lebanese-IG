,Sylvia Feghali,Would love to hear what your experience has been with this instagram page and your organization more broadly,
,LF,"So L-F started actually as a side and passion project in 2016. I had a friend of mine, she is the co-founder. We both met when we were working as journalists before, between 2011-2013, this is how we met. Then both of us left, came back. I was in Lebanon just freelancing, and she came to me and wasa like, “hey, both of us love journalism but hate media– haha in Lebanon, kind of- so why don’t we create our own media?” And my first answer was like, no, haha, because I know how much it costs haha nad how much time. She wanted a website, and I'm like, for having done some websites while I was in the U.S., I know how much work it is to create a website and to maintain a website. So I was like no, we’re not going to create a website. So she was like, “okay why don’t we just start with an instagram page?” And I'm like Okay, here we might have something I was in the US between 2015-2016 and that was the time where there was the everyday features that started. Do you know the everyday pages?",place
,LF,"So Everyday Africa, Everyday Mental Health, Everyday Nigeria, you name it, are basically accounts on Instagram that were started by photographers who wanted to show a different side of news, especially in Africa, because usually, when you talk about Africa, you talk about misery and war, and these photographers who were living there wanted to show the other side of the coin, they wanted to show daily life, this kind of stuff. So I knew from my experience in the States that there was some niche being carved for news that are not like, hardcore news, but more for daily life stuff and that are driven mainly by photographers or at least by photography.",
,LF,"So we started L-F exclusively on social media, so: Instagram, Facebook. So we designed it for social media, etc. And the whole idea was to show the people who are trying to change Lebanon, to inspire others to do the same, and to build bridges between Community.",place; bridging; futurity
,LF,"We were surrounded by social entrepreneurs and by entrepreneurs etc. who were doing stuff, and you never hear about them in the news, so we wanted to talk about them And this is what we did for quite a long time.",bridging; collaboration; barriers
[00:03:42],LF,"So we wanted to talk about them, and this is what we did for quite a long time and on instagram and Facebook. We also wanted to have just pure basic facts about Lebanon, because most of these people don't really know their country and, anyway, sometimes when you read the news you don't even understand what's the fact you just see an analysis or an opinion on something, and you don't know what is actually the fact. We were like what the heck haha so this is what we tried to do on Instagram and Facebook.",truth
[00:04:09],LF,"So in 2016 it was a side project for both of us. 2017 we got in contact with a Social entreprise accelerator called ‘makes sense’ it's a French organization and there are the first ones who told us, “hey I think we can help you make money out of this.”",
[00:04:20],LF,"So in 2017 we entered the whole ecosystem make acceleration and social entrepreneur system that was developing in Lebanon, and we, we got some grants, we won some competition and we figured out how we could try to monetize it.",
[00:04:37],LF,"And so we had some we came up with a business model, we went full time with that, we started recruiting some people, mostly interns but also some juniors.",
[00:04:46],LF,"And in 2018 we incorporated the company and for the first time, we launched our website, because for the first time we had a long form investigation. Like for two or three years, everyone was telling us you need to have a website and I was like no. Like there is no need, we were designing the product for instagram and Facebook and there isn't a need for a website. But then in 2018 we did an investigation on mental health and we at least wanted one platform where everything was in the same place, knowing that we always first design the content for social media and then for the website.",place
[00:05:27],LF,"And then the second year 2019 we actually worked on an investigation– Oh, by the way the investigation went viral– the mental health one like it we reach hundreds of thousands of people, knowing that our following basis 20,000 max so. That was cool actually.",bridging
[00:05:45],LF,"And so 2019 we worked on another investigation, which was about sexuality in Lebanon, like how, especially young people have sex. We started publishing in October.... Then the 17 of October the protests started. So obviously we put it on hold and went covering- for the first time we did news- we never did news before.",
[00:06:08],LF,"For the first time we went like on the streets and we interviewed people, asking them for their hopes, their their dreams, their what they wanted to achieve, and this kind of stuff. And this is what we did for some time, we also did some facts about how to spot fake news about everything that was happening, continued all this and then COVID.",place; hope; futurity; truth
,LF,"So covid happened, and we focused mainly on confinement and and how to stay healthy and like how to keep a good mental health and stay that way. And then we did that, we continue covering social entrepreneurs, we continued doing all this, knowing that there was the crisis at the same time, a lot of immigration, and then you had the blast.",barriers
[00:07:00],LF,"So what happened at the blast is that we published information on instagram and social media and also on our website about how to help. And we also publish some portraits of people who were trying to help, but what happened is that we were six people in the team at the beginning of 2020. Yes, 2020. In September 2020 we were just two in Lebanon, and my partner had left for France before actually covid, then she got stuck there.",bridging; barriers
[00:07:33],LF,"And because of the crisis, here I couldn't pay her anymore, because everything was paid here and I couldn’t send the money, so she found another job, and she moved on.  And of the three, four other journalists were here, three of them left and then honestly after the blast I couldn’t function for almost a year.",barriers; despair
[00:07:50],LF,"I- my brain was not functioning nothing bad happened to me or my close ones or family but still like I couldn't function, I was here out during the blast, like yeah my brain, I think, like moved and I took some time to move back in place.",barriers; despair
[00:08:04],LF,"And so I did continue with the journalists to work on some more like sponsored content. So we used to offer sponsored content for social entreprises, so it is paid and they publish it on our platform and we mention it, but it still goes with our editorial line. So we did that, and then crisis more…So between this I actually focused mainly myself on giving trainings in communication more than L-F and now the media point of it is kind of on hold because I'm not sure if I want to revive it or not.",
[00:08:49],SF,"Thank you for kind of walking me through all of that, I can only imagine it seems like your model is really very tied to people's hope. So you know it makes a lot of sense that that would kind of diminish substantially.",
[00:09:02],LF,"It is, it is picking up again that's why i'm actually wondering, and there is like a need for this kind of stuff but you're right like I was going, we were going with the hopes of people like…",hope
[00:09:22],SF,"yeah and I think that that's a big part of this project for me too is looking at, I mean of course people looking at social media and looking at news media, you know popular news oftentimes have similar critiques that you know it's frying our brains are it's all fake and, but there are a lot of interventions, I feel like that are happening. In the ways that you've been highlighting where people are actually coming together, or people are doing the work on the ground and they don't necessarily get the recognition and actually being able to see that in a more communal experience, maybe might inspire some continued change so that's one of the reasons, actually, that I reached out to you is because I could I got that out of your content so it's good to hear that we're kind of matching in terms of goals and and responses, maybe.",
[00:10:19],SF,"So i'm curious then we've talked a little bit about the process and the intention behind the work, I'm curious what the engagements have been, and if you have any reflections or have had conversations with people that have engaged with the posts or with the work. And maybe even including the people that you've featured on your pages. What are those relationships like or what responses have you gotten?",
[00:10:54],LF,"In terms of engagement, So, In short, it's been very positive and it's also been very intense like. Just to get some stats on Facebook or engagement rates on our post like portray that we were featuring some entrepreneurs, used to be between 15 and 20%, which is actually to us like we had no money and let let me be clear that, especially at the beginning, we didn't invest one money in terms of Like $1 in terms of marketing or boosting our calls it was just like organic engagement and the engagement rates stayed extremely high on Facebook, for as long as we we did it.",
[00:11:33],LF,"A bit less on instagram because I said i'm you can't share, obviously, but we were still a 3% and which is actually pretty good, because people, you have a feel good right.",
[00:11:45],LF,"When you read these kind of stories that you like says not exactly success stories, all the time, but at least they're portrayed as people who are doing things and positive things and trying to change the world, so you have a feel good element to it that make people want to share it, especially on Facebook. On instagram a bit less because it used to be, also a different kind of audience. But, in general, we had a lot of engagement, we had a lot of comments, where we had a really a lot of engagement with people sending us messages and asking for contact numbers for reference etc are two main topics. The first one being everything that's green, so recycling and composting, and all this kind of stuff every time that we did a story on that they asked for the contact of the people were featured because they wanted to recycle their thing or to do the composting not necessarily huge number, and maybe we're talking maybe one to ten people asking but it's still like a first step, yes.",hope; proximity; collaboration
[00:12:50],LF,"And where we got a really a lot of messages was for an investigation on mental health, we had a lot of people ask us for contacts of people being featured because it was the first time that they've heard about trichotillomania, like you know pulling one’s hair. Or they heard about someone else who thought about suicide and made it through and this kind of stuff so.",hope; proximity; collaboration
[00:13:13],LF,"This, we got a lot of engagement and actually the engagement on the mental health investigation went offline like I used to go to to my gym to my swimming pool and people used to stop me and say hey we read your investigation and we find it's really important. So that's the positive like side of it, the more critical, yeah critical side of it is – and it's a critique that we heard very, very early on, but we didn't have the resources to be more– Is a lot of the people who were featuring it sounds a bit like a like communication right like we just interviewed the person and we didn't necessarily interview all the people around them to get a more nuanced point of view, which would have been better let's be clear, and but at one point, it was a question of resources, like how much can we do and how much anyone like ... yeah.",hope; proximity; collaboration; barriers
[00:14:19],SF,"yeah i've been thinking about that with my own project, because you know I don't currently have the resources necessarily to reach out to followers see you know what, which is a really critical part of of looking at this sort of social media ecosystem is like. That part of things so it's something that i've been proud as well yeah. Would you say, have you kept in touch with any of the people that you've met while doing these kinds of features?",collaboration; barriers
[00:14:56],LF,"So, for example, tomorrow i'm actually going in the south of Lebanon with one of the person who got featured in… talking about suicide. I'm actually going through the pages now. Another one is an entrepreneur was still in touch like not only with everyone what yeah we did we did stay in contact with I don't know what kind of. A no I wouldn't know how what percentage, but we did stay in touch with some of them.",collaboration; place; proximity
[00:15:28],SF,yeah that's exciting. So I think there's another another kind of critique of social media is that it's very fleeting and and there's not a lot of lasting impact necessarily. Or maybe this is one of the shallow critiques but I I feel like there are genuine connections that are made with with this kind of work like you said it happens offline as well…,
[00:15:52],LF,"It does, because in like to portray all the people we portrayed we actually like went to them right we interviewed them and to get the emotional side of their stories you actually need to really interview them in this for usually more than an hour to get the to get what we call the why.",proximity; truth
[00:16:09],LF,"Like, why do they do what they doing they Yes, they want to change the word but, but in a way in that slick way with that company or with that solution so we used to take like an hour an hour and a half, just to listen to their stories and this kind of connection, which is real life connection is kind of precious, I feel, these days, because it, it takes time right and also kind of listening skills I guess, which are not necessarily very encouraged encouraged here in Lebanon, at least so like say it's not encouraged to open up right so to provide to provide a space where you actually allow people to open up slowly and slowly, it creates the bonds. So yeah.",proximity; truth; bridging
[00:17:20],SF,"Okay let's see Oh, I did want to ask you, so you obviously started this with Facebook and instagram in mind, what do you think the engagement on instagram or Facebook, I mean if you would prefer to talk about that, what do you think that it can offer that's different from other forms of connection.",
[00:17:41],LF,Like which one like comments on websites where it's something or?,
[00:17:45],SF,"yeah, so it's a platform that is mainly driven by connectivity. And so it, it takes different forms of connectivity than we do in our sort of everyday interactions and I guess maybe the question I'm posing is",
[00:18:07],SF,"What did you see in terms of potential for connection there that doesn't necessarily exist outside, or is there any?",
[00:18:19],LF,"Yeah there is one, at least for us that I think was important, is. We talked about entrepreneurs from all over the country from different religions different socioeconomic backgrounds, different education different everything with no discrimination right because luckily, for us. Both my partner and myself, who are from two different backgrounds different two different religions two different areas, Lebanon, and you know how living and veggies can be impossible right like if you're from Beirut you probably haven't seen anything else, and you if you're from a Muslim neighborhood in in Tyre probably most of your friends are Muslims and same for Christians, etc, so it's extremely hard to create bridges and to put in touch people who are doing the same things but in two different parts the country or even the same town. ",place; proximity; barriers; bridging; 
[00:19:00],LF,"And I think that we were part of, because we're were not the only one working that, is show that like you can have a startup doing recycling in Tripoli and another one doing something in Nabatieh, and they could talk and maybe benefit from each other's competencies and knowledge and experience. So again we're were not the only one to get people in touch and make them talk, etc, but I feel that we were part of bringing this conversation forward like saying hey we don't care if you're from from Baalbeck, Nabatieh, Beirut, Tyre, and if you're Muslim; Sunni, Shia, Christian, if you come from money, if you don’t come from money, if you        finish your studies, if you didn't finish your studies, as long as you're doing something, and I feel that this allows for some connection to happen, like, outside of us. Like we just talked about these people and they can meet actually, right. This, this is one important thing.",place; proximity; bridging; collaboration; 
[00:20:27],LF,"Another type of connectivity like I always say when I give trainings I always say that social media is a conversation. Like it’s the only platform where you have people commenting things straight away or asking straight away, and you need to answer. So if you made a mistake, then people will tell you, and you can amend. So in a way it makes the work easier because you don't have to be perfect all the time, but in another way they also have to be really careful because people can be very whew like fire in here,",
[00:21:01],LF,"But at least like,  there is a,  it's not–  I used to write for like a paper magazine right, and when you made a mistake, you corrected them in the second issue, but then on the Internet or on like in the paper issue, the mistake is still here and it’s going to stay forever. Whereas on social media you just edit you just change. That's also the same for the web, but yeah you have these comments and these connections yeah.",collaboration
[00:21:29],SF,"yeah there's a there's a time piece to it right, you can kind of continue participating in the conversation in real time. One question, I do have is specifically about kind of content that you're engaging with during the uprising, so I know you mentioned that you guys were going out in the streets and talking to people could you tell me a little bit more about what that looks like and maybe how how did you decide because you said you're going from a more long form and investigation and then switch quickly to doing that what was that process like.",
[00:22:37],LF,"So, yeah we were doing long form investigations, but at the core, not at the core, but like the routine of what we were doing, we were mostly doing portraits and facts presented in short format. So we knew how to do short. What we did not know how to do was news, it’s not the same. Like you can do a piece of cold information and still present it in a short format which we knew how to do. But news is different. You need to be underground, you need to be aware of the context you need to be able to explain and you need to fast and let’s be clear, I'm not a news person. My partner was more of a news person than I was, but it’s still like it's a different skills sets, I feel. But why we decided to go on the streets, so we went on the street, but we didn't necessarily cover news in terms of who's beating who and where is the army and and where are the the events we didn't do that we actually went down and ask people what they wanted, and we did portraits. So we did it the way we knew how to do.",
[00:23:41],LF,"Why we decided to go, because it was so huge that obviously was the only thing worth talking about in the country and, anyway, like there was no space for anything else, let's be clear. Like imagine talking about sexuality when when… yeah no it didn't make sense, let's be clear. Like people don't care. Everyone was on the street, everyone that we knew was on the street, all our Community was on the streets. We were all– like I wanted to protest and my partner wanted to protest. We wanted to be down there, it was was a huge movement. And at the beginning, at least, it was accelerating. We really decided to go down because we wanted to be there, because, it was huge, because you could feel it actually. We did it the way we knew how to do it, so we went down and we did some portraits with features of people like what they want, what their dreams, etc, and we also did some pure facts about how to spot fake information because there were lots of its fake information or how to take care of your mental health when being down there when it was apparent, when it was actually clear that was going to take some time.",place; proximity; truth; futurity
[00:24:50],LF,"Is it, is it a revolution, is it not revolution and like what's the meaning of revolution and the thawra. Let’s see what else we have. Oh- the fun stuff that we also saw, like a lot of little things yeah–",truth; futurity
[00:25:07],SF,Go ahead keep going.,
[00:25:08],LF,"No that wasn't actually just checking what we wrote about, but this is mainly what we wrote about.",
[00:25:15],SF,"Are those features still up on the website, then, and on your pages?",
[00:25:22],LF,"All the all these protests etc are definitely still on instagram on a certain page that we decided for red color code, so you can see them, it’s actually the Lebanese flag, so you could see them. Now what happened is that we also publish some stories and the stories are not there anymore. And I don't know if we managed to put them on the websites, because our beautiful Internet connection at the time was not really there, and I think it got worse after that.",place; barriers
[00:25:51],SF,classic.,
[00:25:58],SF,"yeah great yeah I would love to kind of go back and revisit the post from that time so i'll probably do that, after our conversation that's awesome actually. Everything you were just mentioning reminded me a lot of the experience being in the US during the summer of 2020 with all of the like black lives matter protests and people so part of this project for me is is i'm focusing on you know people who are posting and contributing to this larger kind of conversation about Lebanon, but a lot of there's so many parallels between the ways that people are connecting via content. In lots of different kind of protest environments and so i'm really curious to see how they, if there are similarities and specific differences, because it is a lot of the same thing you know sharing. You know how to spot fake news or how to show up for each other in a very safe way how to take care of the people around you and it felt like you know we're living in in these experiences, where we can't necessarily depend on the systems that that say that they're there to protect us, so we have to protect one another and so finding the spaces to do that is really important.",
[00:27:30],LF,"It is and that reminds me, we also shared a lot of information and throw stories like about, for example, how to protect yourself, because some people were did a really good job at explaining. How to protect yourself from tear gas with vinegar, and all this kind of stuff and because the content was here very like we didn't want to redo it we just shared it on on our stories.",truth; bridging; collaboration; hope
[00:27:53],LF,"And also like where the Red Cross was in case anything happened, and this kind of stuff so we shared in our story, we used our stories at that time because it's also a question of you know, with how the platforms before, right, act at the beginning, when we started it was mostly Facebook that was really engaging and then instagram was more about photography, but we can finish loosen things and then very quickly story started picking up and today on instagram, it's a mess I don't know what to expect and more. But I think it's mostly videos more and more, but, it's yeah.",proximity; place; barriers; futurity
[00:28:34],SF,"That actually reminds me, I wanted to ask you if there any other accounts or organizations that you were following or that you were working together with or an inspired by on any of these platforms.",
[00:28:51],LF,"And so, with it, I don't know if you count that as working together, but with this some cross publication, with some platforms. Like we did one was better as media, but then it's more a website for them, and will it one was the material matter, which is the French newsletter and influence, but in terms of really like social media media platforms of it like us.",
[00:29:20],LF,"We didn't really work together it's like… So one of the main problem in the ecosystem in Lebanon, like all the ecosystem is that it's actually really hard to have people work together and one of the reason is that everyone is doing their stuff and if everyone is overworked and then it's actually hard to get some time to take some time to see how you can collaborate with others, and also, even when you decide to collaborate with others, if you don't have one person in charge of making sure the collaboration works in each of the company, it will fail because people won't have the time but let's be clear, because you also need to like when you collaborate with someone you need to deviate just a bit from what you do, you need to bring interest of it not too far, but just have it and you need someone to do that, like you need someone who's in charge of doing it because otherwise it will never be a priority for the people who are so focused on doing the thing.",collaboration; barriers; 
[00:30:18],LF,"Yeah he people will also tell you that there is a problem of egos and all this kind of stuff which is true, too but this I feel you can work around what you cannot work around it is limited resources. So accounts to that we will following just for the protest or in general?",collaboration; barriers; 
[00:30:38],SF,in general.,
[00:30:40],LF,"To in general, we were following megaphone, megaphone news because they started with us, and it was it was then to get news about what's happening.",truth; place; proximity
[00:30:50],LF,"During the protest, there was something called the daleel thawra leaders photo they still here, but they used to give us like a rundown of where the protests over the what's happening, when and where you can eat where you can train where you have the respect that he thought it was pretty good and when they were created later I follow impact Lebanon and so impact even was created, I think at the later stage. When the closest.",truth; place; proximity
[00:31:14],LF,"But they're really they were really good in terms of actually structuring the bits not not the sector, which is the access to the sector and were really good at raising funds and giving the funds to the to the NGOs and making sure that this these funds went really to what they were supposed to go and not not in bribes or whatever it is.",truth; place; proximity
[00:31:39],LF,So these ones thing into service to follow the rules And just to see what they were doing but they're not really active on social media at that time and all the accelerators so.,
[00:31:57],LF,"At that time there were several days, and it was bloom god's very tech the tech is still active, by the way I forgot to make sense.",
[00:32:14],LF,"Like these were the ones in Lebanon that we were following and trying to remember after that anything that was related to mental health, obviously so embrace it drop those these are NGOs. But yeah like these are the main ones that I have in my mind.",
[00:32:34],SF,"yeah no that's great that's great i'm curious as well, and I know you said, your team slowly trickled out of Lebanon, but did you find that you were mostly focused on content and profiles and people within Lebanon was that sort of the the whole idea behind behind your work or did you also engage with people outside like in the diaspora.",
[00:33:03],LF,"So we also engage with people outside our main focus was even if people. It was a choice, like to really ask yourself whether we should include us all the refugees and the people.Actually, the Syrian civil war, not officially refugees in here, but we decided that we wanted to do something about that even use identity and thanks, so we decided to focus on these people and that like you said, the beginning and we started just with level and because, again problem of resources, but then, when my partner's radio. was in France and was stuck there she actually interviewed the best work and the original plan was for her to actually go for four months actually in France.",place; collaboration
[00:33:46],LF,"And because she had some training to do and then she was going to continue interviewing people from the last four actually over there, so we also interview people from day that's why sometimes we interview them when they came to Lebanon just a question of access, because for a very long time, we never did interviews on zoom because you can't get the same level of trust people you don't know. Like you need to sit down with them and have a coffee and try again and let them take zoom, especially the connections here like yes Severe whether you want it or not, yeah.",proximity; barriers; place
[00:34:24],SF,"So does it's always a big question, especially at school are always asking us, you know. To really think carefully for doing interviews on zoom so appreciate this your willingness to do this.",
[00:34:39],LF,"i'm happy, like the i'm always happy to do it because I feel like it does have a lot of advantages like, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to have this conversation right. You're also not asking me to spill my guts to you. Which is, which is good for me, but we asked, we used to ask people to spill their guts right so.",
[00:35:00],SF,"that's right, it is you do have to share a coffee.",
[00:35:05],LF,or a whiskey,
[00:35:07],SF,haha  exactly.,
[00:35:16],SF,"Well, I guess My final question, I think you kind of have answered it but really it's just what is the status of the account or what is the status of I guess engage your engagement on social media. How do you and how do you feel about the content, do you think it'll take a new direction.",
[00:35:35],LF,"And so, as I mentioned, like the media part of it is on hold, I still have the training and communication ports, a bit like is basically because of why that makes money has been here the. It will depend on a lot of factors, one of them being whether I decided to stay in Lebanon or not, because that's one thing to consider and the other one being that. If I want to continue doing it or if I want to relaunch the platform and people, which means I need money, and I would not, I would not do exactly the same thing because anyway, like situation has changed obviously so most real going to talk, because this is where people are now and our still talk about people were trying to change things, etc, what i'll probably do our investigations, etc.",futurity
[00:36:31],LF,"All this, depending on whether I decide to say what I decide to put my focus on it and to try to raise funds to do it and all this i'll enter after my holidays. I need to clear my mind, a bit because it's been, it's been like three four years let's say that way, so, so I need to clear up a bit my lines before taking any decisions.",barriers
[00:37:01],SF,"yeah This makes a lot of sense, well, I look forward to keeping in touch you know whether like directly or just kind of passively.Checking in to see how things are going and I'm eager to see what shape things will take.",
[00:37:19],LF,Pleasure.,
